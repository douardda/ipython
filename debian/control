Package: python-ipython4
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: Enhanced interactive Python shell (Python 2 version)
 IPython can be used as a replacement for the standard Python shell,
 or it can be used as a complete working environment for scientific
 computing (like Matlab or Mathematica) when paired with the standard
 Python scientific and numerical tools. It supports dynamic object
 introspections, numbered input/output prompts, a macro system,
 session logging, session restoring, complete system shell access,
 verbose and colored traceback reports, auto-parentheses, auto-quoting,
 and is embeddable in other Python programs.
 .
 This package contains the backend terminal shell for Python 2: for
 the actual frontend install ipython.
